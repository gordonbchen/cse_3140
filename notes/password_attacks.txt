Password attacks
* Dict of common passwords, private info, heuristics
* Password of same user in exposed lists
* Defense: rate-limit password attempts
* GPU rig for fast hashing (parallel computing)
* Can try all 8 char passwords < 1hr, 2^49 guesses/hour

Hashing and Salting
* Store password hashes instead of plain text 
* Crypographic hash function (SHA-256)
	* One-way: computationally infeasible to go h(x) -> x
	* Collision resistance: can't find h(x') = h(x)
* Rainbow tables: hackers precompute hashes of common tables, can quickly find matching passwords
* Salting: h(pw||salt), append salt to password
	* Salt picked randomly for every user, no Rainbow table attacks
	* Store hashed password and salt
